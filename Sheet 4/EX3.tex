\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
    \item If we compute the power iteration on $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ for 5 iterations, we find the following eigenvectors:
\begin{itemize}
    \item for $M_{1}$ : (-0.948, -0.318)
    \item for $M_{2}$ : (0.410, 0.404, 0.817)
\end{itemize}
     \item if we compute three iterations of the power iteration procedure for $M_{3}$, we find : ( 0.577,  0.577, -0.577).
     
     The Power Iteration will not converge, because if we calculate the eigenvalues of $M_{3}$, we will find 2 values  -2 and 2. So we don't have the assumption 5.24. That's why the Power Iteration Algo fails.  
     \item  $M_{1}$ have two eigenvalues $\lambda_{1} = -2$ and $\lambda_{2} = -1$ 
     
     If we apply the power iteration algo on $M_{1}^{-1}$ , we will find the eigenvector of $M_{1}$ associated with $\lambda_{2}$ 
     We find :(0.970, 0.239)
     \item 
\begin{itemize}
    \item for $M_{4}$ it needs 3 iterations and the eigenvector is :
    
    (0.6401, 0.7682)
    \item for $M_{5}$ it needs 60 iterations and the eigenvector is   :
    
    (0.5814, 0.8135)
\end{itemize}
     
\end{enumerate}
