\section*{Exercise 1}
We have $\mathcal{Q}$ a symmetric Markov chain.
Let $Q$ be it's transition matrix.
From Lemma 6.4 we have $\pi$ is the stationary distribution then $\pi_ia_{ij}=\pi_ja_{ji}$ for all $i,j\in \left[n\right]$ and $a_{ij}=a_{ji}$.
So $\pi_i = \pi_j$ for all $i\in[n]$.
So $\pi$ is uniform over $[n,n]$.

So for every connected,m symmetric Markov chain we have the same stationary distribution $\pi$ and we know that $\pi$ is unique from Theorem 6.2.
